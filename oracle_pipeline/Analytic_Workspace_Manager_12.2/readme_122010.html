<h3>Analytic Workspace Manager application Plug-ins</h3>
<p>This release of Analytic Workspace Manager includes two application plug-ins:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition (OBIEE) Plug-in for Analytic Workspace Manager (obieeplugin.jar) lets you quickly create an OBIEE 10g or 11g repository that enables the
OBIEE Server (and therefore any OBIEE client, including Dashboards, Answers, Delivers, and the MS Office Plug-in) to query Oracle Database 11g OLAP cubes.</li>
  <li>The Data Validation Plug-in for Analytic Workspace Manager (datavplugin.jar) provides tests to quickly find conditions in dimension table data that might cause errors when
  maintaining an OLAP dimension or cause problems when querying a cube using business intelligence tools. The data validation plug-in also includes methods that can quickly fix many
  different types of data errors in dimension tables. Please refer to the Review Guide for Data Validation Plug-in.pdf for a tutorial on the use of the Data Validation Plug-in.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please refer to the documentation of each application plug-in for a description of each tool and the Oracle support policy for these plug-ins.</p>
</ul>
<h3>How To Install </h3>

  <p><strong>New installation of Analytic Workspace Manager 12.2.0.1.0</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>If you are installing Analytic Workspace Manager for the first time, copy the extracted files into a new directory.</li>
    <li>Make sure your environment has at least JRE version 1.8 (Java Runtime Environment) installed.  This is required to be able to run Analytic Workspace Manager as a single jar file. </li>
    <li>Update the awm.bat file included in the kit with the directory path of the version of the Java Runtime Environment installed in your environment and then execute this file to start Analytic Workspace Manager.</li>
</ol>

  <p>
<p><strong>Upgrading to Analytic Workspace Manager 12.2.0.1.0 from a previous release</strong></p>

  <ol>
    <li>If you are upgrading to Analytic Workspace Manager from a prior release, choose one of the following two options for handling the upgrade:</li>
    <p>Option 1:	First, create a backup copy of the installation directory for your previous release of AWM.  Copy the location of the directory and all subdirectories of the installed version of AWM to a backup
	directory.  Second, delete the prior version of AWM by removing the awm12.x.x.x.x.jar file (where x.x.x.x. is the release, e.g. 12.1.0.1.0) from the existing installation directory.  Lastly, install the new version
	of AWM, by copying the awm12.2.0.1.0.jar file, extracted from the awm122010_Standalone.zip, to this installation directory.
</p>
    <p>Option 2:	First, follow the instructions for a new installation of Analytic Workspace Manager 12.2.0.1.0, as documented above.  Secondly, you will need to copy any user-written plugins or XML templates
	from the previous version of AWM to the new directories where you have installed the new version of AWM.  Third, you should copy from the previous version of AWM, the awm.properties file which stores the AWM
	preferences settings and the awmdb.properties file which stores database connection settings, to the directories where you have installed the new version of AWM.   This will ensure that any previous configuration
	settings will be migrated to the new installation of AWM.
</p>

    <p><li>Make sure your environment has at least JRE version 1.8 (Java Runtime Environment) installed.  This is required to be able to run Analytic Workspace Manager as a single jar file. </li>
</p>
    <li>Update the awm.bat file included in the kit with the directory path of the version of the Java Runtime Environment installed in your environment and then execute this file to start Analytic Workspace Manager.</li>

    <p>Additionally, you may start the awm12.2.0.1.0.jar file by executing the jar file or by running the jar file from a command line as follows:</p>

    <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">start javaw –mx1024m -jar awm12.2.0.1.0.jar</font></p>

    <li>After starting AWM for the first time, you should verify that the preference settings for directories in the AWM configuration are set properly for the new version of AWM.  Select the Configuration option item
	from the Tools menu in AWM to adjust these settings.  The preference settings to check are:</li>
<p>
<p>General – Template directory</p>

<p>Logging – Session Logging Directory Location</p>

<p>Plugin – Plugin directory</p>
